            <p>Health Hack is running as a pilot with plans to run a larger sponsored event in October 2014. <br>More Infomation on Health Hack is available from their website here: <a href="http://blogs.cmdn.dundee.ac.uk/healthhack/"> Dundee Health Hack</a>
			<br><br>The Project we decided to undertake started as investigation into the security of the IBorescope device to determine if it was feasible to use it in a teaching environment between multiple clients over a network connection. During the Project we discovered a way to implement a proof of concept system using the device whilst also testing the security. The aim was to determine if it was possible to use the device in a secure way without allowing other's to access the device directly by revealing the SSDI and Password.   </p><br />
        <p>The solution to this was to create an authentical server inbetween the client's and the device to control access and allow only the server access directly to the device. This website contains part of the proof of concept in the form of a live steam from the device whenever the server is enabled and connected to the device.</p><br />
